                  <p>Since the beginning of December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around
                    the world, which has led to increased discussions across online platforms. These conversations have
                    also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has
                    linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19. </p>

                  <p>Perhaps the most prevalent of all the theories is the suggestion that 5G degrades the immune
                    system, and that this has helped spread COVID-19. 5G waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum
                    and it is true that higher frequency radiation at the end of this spectrum does pose dangers. That’s
                    because these high-frequency waves are “ionising”, meaning they can cause internal damage to our
                    bodies if exposure is too great. However, according to research and tests by the World Health
                    Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP),
                    5G is not harmful to health and it does not cause any disease.

                  <p>
                    Full Fact's first debunking of the theory hinged on a Facebook post which claimed Wuhan in China —
                    where the coronavirus outbreak first began — is also where 5G began to roll out. There is no
                    evidence to suggest that Wuhan was the very first Chinese city to start building out 5G, but rather
                    multiple reports found by Full Fact said it was among multiple cities selected to pilot the
                    technology.
