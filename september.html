                  <p>There are many arguments as to what may or may not have happened during 9/11 but the one that runs
                    most rampant is that it was organised not by Al-Qaeda but by the USA themselves. This was due to
                    many reasons such as the way the towers fell, the reaction to 9/11 by the stock exchange.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Many people believe the way the towers fell couldn’t have been the result of only one plane flying
                    into it and exploding as it simply doesn’t have the power to slice and collapse a whole building.
                    They believe that it was a product of controlled demolition in which there were already many bombs
                    planted throughout the building explaining the explosions occurring throughout the building.



                  <p>
                    Another reason is that prior to 9/11 there were many “put options” placed on United Airlines and
                    American Airlines, this suggests there may have been some form of insider information leaked to
                    those in the trading world where they had enough to rearrange assets in order to benefit from this.


                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Further reasons include that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the
                    U.S. government. Some claim that the holes in the Pentagon walls were far too small to have been
                    made by a Boeing 757.
